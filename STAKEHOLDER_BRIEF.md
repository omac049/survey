# Workforce Capability & Education Alignment Survey (2026)
## Stakeholder Brief

**Prepared:** December 2025  
**Version:** 3.0 (Major Restructure)  
**Status:** Ready for Review

---

## Executive Summary

The survey has been **substantially restructured** to align with UAGC's strategic initiative around **Professional Studies degree naming** (APS/BPS/MPS) and the **90-credit bachelor's pilot program**. Rather than focusing narrowly on HR perceptions of online vs. traditional degrees, the new survey explores broader themes of workforce capability, applied education value, and education-industry partnerships.

### Why This Matters

UAGC is transitioning its degree nomenclature:
- **AA** → **APS** (Associate of Professional Studies)
- **BA/BS** → **BPS** (Bachelor of Professional Studies, 90 credits)
- **MA/MS** → **MPS** (Master of Professional Studies)

This survey will generate data to:
1. **Validate market positioning** for workforce-aligned education
2. **Support content marketing** with employer-endorsed insights
3. **Inform partnership development** with industry organizations
4. **Build credibility** for the 90-credit accelerated pathway
