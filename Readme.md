# HR Manager Survey – Online Learning vs. Traditional Education (2025 Employer Study)

## Introduction

This survey is part of a 2025 research study exploring how employers perceive online education relative to traditional, in‑person programs.

Recent research shows that:
- **87.4%** of employers who track degree modality have hired graduates with online degrees
- **100%** of those employers pay online‑degree graduates the same starting salary as their peers who studied in person ([NACE Job Outlook 2024](https://www.naceweb.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2023/publication/research-report/2024-nace-job-outlook.pdf))
- At a global level, more than half of employers (**55%**) say they value graduates of online or predominantly online programs just as much as those from in‑person programs ([GMAC Corporate Recruiters Survey 2025](https://www.gmac.com/market-intelligence-and-research/research-library/employment-outlook/2025-corporate-recruiters-survey-report))
- However, only **5%** of U.S. employers strongly agree and **23%** agree that their company values graduates of online and in‑person programs equally ([BestColleges Survey Analysis](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/employers-embrace-online-degrees-gmac-corporate-recruiters/))

This survey aims to understand where your organization fits within these trends. Your responses will remain confidential and will be aggregated for analysis.
